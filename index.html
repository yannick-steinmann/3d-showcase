              This website was built to showcase my current skills using
              Three.js, GSAP and Blender, which I have learnt over the summer of
              2022 as a side-project. You might learn a thing or two about me as well :)

              I like taking ideas from initial sketch to release, then measure
              the impact. As a product manager, I work in teams of experts but I also enjoy being hands-on and design and code myself. 
              It helps me to validate prototypes with the design team or work out the technical details with the engineers. In the end, I 
              love bringing everyone together to create a digital experience
              that people love.

            <p class="section-text">
              I have been working in startups and tech since 2017. My last
              stations were as a Product Lead at Friendsurance and as a
              freelance Product consultant/coach for a variety of startup
              clients.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Focus on WHAT to build</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              Product Discovery is crucial for a product's success but in my experience it falls
              short far too often. That's why I put an extra effort into Discovery. 
              At Friendsurance, I have set up a Product
              Discovery process for a team of 20+ contributors, which enabled us
              to get budget and focus for the necessary research, validate ideas and fill the product roadmap
              with features that actually made a difference.

            <p class="section-text">
              Digital products allow us to deeply understand user behavior and
              preferences by leveraging data. I combine this data with my
              knowledge of growth models, experiment results and qualitative
              research to create a digital experience that acquires, activates
              and retains users sustainably.

              I enjoy doing all kinds of sports, from biking to hiking to yoga.
              Living in a big city such as Berlin I cherish the moments when I
              get to spend time outdoors. A few years ago, I also picked up kitesurfing.

              I started playing the piano in 2020 (thanks Covid!) and still play at least an hour per day. 
              I also sing in a choir and paint
              and sketch a lot. For better or worse, all the paintings hanging
              in my apartment are by me. Reactions so far ranged from shy
              acknowledgement to honest praise.
